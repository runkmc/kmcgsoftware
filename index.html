				<p>Do you ever gaze into the night sky, thinking, "I wonder how
				many asteroids, massive bodies hurtling through space at
				mind-boggling speeds and capable of destroying all life should
				they strike Earth are dangerously close to us at this very
				moment?"</p>
				<p>Wonder no more! Neos has got your back. Neos shows you all
				of the asteroids that are making their closest pass to Earth
				today. Be sure to check Neos every day to see which new group
				of giant space rocks could kill us all next time they pass by
				if their orbit is disturbed by a fraction of a percent.

				<p>When my son got his feeding tube, trying to keep track of how

				between iOS devices so you and other caregivers always have the

				<h1>Earthquakr</h1>
				<p>Whenever I feel an earthquake, I immediately want to know the answers
				to two questions: Where was it centered, and how strong was
				it?</p>
				<p>Earthquakr answers these questions for you.</p>
				<p>Earthquakr uses your location to find nearby earthquakes and,
				 using a totally complicated algorithm that someone much
				 smarter than me came up with, displays only the earthquakes
				 you would have felt at your location within the last 12
				 hours.</p>
				<p>So the next time you hear your car alarm go off while your
				 pets cower in fear; while you feel the earth beneath your
				 feet, that same earth you once thought safe and sturdy,
				 crumble and shatter; while you begin to question the trust
				 you've placed in anything or anyone else, remember: at least
				 now you have Earthquakr by your side.</p>
				<p>Earthquakr. Whole lotta shaking going on down there. Contact
